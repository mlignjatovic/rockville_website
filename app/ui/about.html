		<h3>Specialities</h3>
		<p>Kitchen and bath remodeling is something we are really specialized in. We also do painting, flooring and handyman services. Small and dependable crew is great with customer service and always doing one project at the time.</p>
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Established in 2005.
We had several crews at one point of time but it was hard to maintain the quality of work so we are back to one crew and couple helpers at the time when needed. All jobs are supervised daily by the owner.</p>
		<h3>Business Owner</h3>
		<p>Luka holds Civil engineering degree, Maryland stationary engineering first class license and Maryland home improvement commission license.</p>
