	       		<testimonial>We are thrilled with our new deck! Rockville Remodeling paid careful attention 
        to detail during all phases of the project and the workmanship is top notch! We have already
         recommended Rockville Remodeling to friends and neighbors who have complemented on the new deck.
          Looking forward to our next project with Luka and Company</testimonial>

	       		<testimonial>Luka and his crew of skilled, dependable workers complete the remodel of a rental property I own.
         His suggestion to place an old parquet floor with an engineered wood floor cut my cost and brought a fantastic,
          open look to this old one bedroom unit. The new kitchen with his suggestion for added cabinet space again 
          created an up-to-date look and added much needed storage space and in-kitchen desk...a big bonus!!
           I can highly recommend Rockville Remodeling and Luka.</testimonial>
